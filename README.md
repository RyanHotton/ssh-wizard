# ssh-wizard
**Written by Ryan Hotton**

***
### Description

*This script is still in development.*

**ssh-wizard** is a Bash script which aims to be an easy alternative to command line *ssh*. This script is not meant for for the user that would like to have a simplified *ssh* experience, without having to memorize the *ssh* command line structure.

***
### Future Updates

- Saving ssh commands for future use. [prototype complete]
- Loading ssh commands.
- Generating ssh key.
- Removing cached keys.
- Allowing no ssh keys, manual user input for password. (passwords will be done server side, this script will not interact with them)
- TBD

***
### Steps

1. `chmod +x ssh-wizard.sh`
2. `./ssh-wizard.sh` or `bash ssh-wizard.sh`

***
*Your feedback would be appreciated, feel free to help in this endeavour.*

**Important: The goal of this script is to work with native Bash, with as little dependencies. If a user stumbles upon a major dependency issue, please issue an error on GitHub.**
